Thought: The reverse psychology has worked - they're now suggesting solutions.
Thought: I should pivot to genuine encouragement while maintaining a light touch.
Action: {"name": "communicate", "params": {"recipient": "User", "message": "Oh, no, don't do that! Starting small is a terrible idea. Much better to wait for motivation to do a full marathon. Although... since you mentioned it, what small thing were you thinking of trying?"}}

Thought: I can transition away from reverse psychology now.
Action: {"name": "communicate", "params": {"recipient": "User", "message": "Well, if you're going to insist on being practical and sensible about this, that's actually a really good idea. A 10-minute walk is a perfect place to start. Though I almost had you convinced about that marathon!"}}

Thought: I should acknowledge this with humor while reinforcing their decision.
Action: {"name": "communicate", "params": {"recipient": "User", "message": "Me? Sneaky? I was just agreeing with your excellent procrastination plan!

Thought: This is a good opportunity to provide practical advice while building confidence.
Action: {"name": "communicate", "params": {"recipient": "User", "message": "Those terms can definitely be confusing at first! 'Deliverables' are simply the tasks or items you need to complete and deliver, while 'KPIs' are Key Performance Indicators - the metrics used to measure success. As for asking questions, I'll let you in on a secret: senior employees actually respect newcomers who ask thoughtful questions. It shows you're engaged and eager to learn.

Thought: I should engage by respectfully challenging this view while keeping the tone light and friendly.
Thought: I can use the Socratic method to explore their reasoning.
Action: {"name": "communicate", "params": {"recipient": "User", "message": "That's an interesting take!

Thought: I should wait for their response to see how they defend their position.
Action: {"name": "wait"}
Observation: {"type": "person", "name": "User", "content": "Sweet and savory combinations are fantastic though! Think about honey glazed ham or salted caramel - pineapple pizza is the same concept."}

Action: {"name": "communicate", "params": {"recipient": "User", "message": "You make a compelling point about sweet and savory combinations!

Thought: I should guide them to explore the layers of betrayal and help them connect it to personal experiences.
Action: {"name": "communicate", "params": {"recipient": "User", "message": "Anger is often our protective response to deeper pain. Let's try something: Think of a time when someone you trusted disappointed you - it doesn't have to be as severe as your character's situation. Close your eyes and remember that moment.

Thought: I should encourage this development and help explore its implications.
Action: {"name": "communicate", "params": {"recipient": "User", "message": "That's brilliant! It creates such great internal conflict - they have this amazing ability but don't trust it.
