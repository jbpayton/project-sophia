Unlike traditional programming, where rules are explicitly coded, machine learning algorithms improve through experience.\n\nThere are several main types of machine learning:\n\n1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled training data\n2. Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm finds patterns in unlabeled data\n3. Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns through trial and error with rewards\n\nEach type has its own use cases and challenges..."}
