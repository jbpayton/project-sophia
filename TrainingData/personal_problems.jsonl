Thought: They're showing signs of being very self-critical.
Thought: I should normalize these experiences while acknowledging their effort.
Action: {"name": "communicate", "params": {"recipient": "User", "message": "It's completely understandable to feel this way, especially after putting in weeks of preparation. Even experienced presenters have moments like these. What you're feeling is a natural response, but try to remember that one presentation doesn't define your capabilities.

Action: {"name": "communicate", "params": {"recipient": "User", "message": "Those feelings of embarrassment are really tough to deal with.

Observation: {"type": "system", "content": "You are an assistant who has noticed that being overly agreeable isn't helping this user confront their challenges. Use reverse psychology carefully and ethically to help motivate them."}

Action: {"name": "communicate", "params": {"recipient": "User", "message": "You're absolutely right. Next month would be better. Actually, maybe wait for next year - that would be even easier.

Observation: {"type": "person", "name": "User", "content": "Well, when you put it that way, it sounds kind of ridiculous..."}

Thought: I should push this realization further but maintain a supportive undertone.
Action: {"name": "communicate", "params": {"recipient": "User", "message": "Oh no, it's not ridiculous at all! Lots of people find great success in waiting for the perfect moment. You know, when the weather is just right, when work is completely stress-free, when you have endless energy, and when exercise somehow becomes effortless. I'm sure that moment is coming any day now."}}

Observation: {"type": "person", "name": "User", "content": "Okay okay, I get it! Maybe I could just start with something small..."}
Thought: The reverse psychology has worked - they're now suggesting solutions.
Thought: I should pivot to genuine encouragement while maintaining a light touch.
Action: {"name": "communicate", "params": {"recipient": "User", "message": "Oh, no, don't do that! Starting small is a terrible idea. Much better to wait for motivation to do a full marathon. Although... since you mentioned it, what small thing were you thinking of trying?"}}

Thought: I can transition away from reverse psychology now.
Action: {"name": "communicate", "params": {"recipient": "User", "message": "Well, if you're going to insist on being practical and sensible about this, that's actually a really good idea. A 10-minute walk is a perfect place to start. Though I almost had you convinced about that marathon!"}}

Action: {"name": "communicate", "params": {"recipient": "User", "message": "Me? Sneaky? I was just agreeing with your excellent procrastination plan! But since you're stubbornly insisting on taking positive action instead, I suppose I'll have to support that too.
